# Eyad Portfolio â€” GitHub Pages

A ready-to-publish static portfolio for **Eyad Tarek Nagy** (Digital IC Design & Verification).

## âœ… How to publish on GitHub Pages (from phone or PC)

1. Create a new repo here: https://github.com/new  
   **Name it** either any name you like, or `eyadnagy.github.io` to make it your main site.
2. Click **"Upload files"** and upload all the files in this folder (or just upload the ZIP then click **"Extract"** if youâ€™re on desktop).
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** (left sidebar in the repo).  
   - Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Source: Deploy from a branch**.  
   - Choose **Branch: `main`** and **Folder: `/ (root)`** then **Save**.
4. Wait a minute and open the URL that GitHub shows you (it will be like `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO` or `https://USERNAME.github.io`).

> Tip: If nothing shows, make sure `index.html` is in the root of the repo (not inside another folder).

## ðŸ›  Editing

- Change text inside `index.html`.
- Colors & layout live in `style.css`.
- Add your own images into `assets/` and link them from `index.html`.
- Replace the `Download CV` button with your latest PDF if needed.

## ðŸ“§ Contact form (optional)

The form is a static demo. To make it send emails, connect it to a service like **Netlify Forms** or **Formspree** (free tiers available).

## ðŸ”’ No build tools

This site is pure HTML/CSS/JS â€” works perfectly on GitHub Pages without extra config.
